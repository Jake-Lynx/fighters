1. **Action**: Games focused on physical challenges, combat, and reflexes. Examples include platformers, beat 'em ups, and hack-and-slash games.

2. **Adventure**: Games that emphasize story-driven experiences, exploration, and puzzle-solving. This genre often includes point-and-click adventures and interactive narratives.
