2. **PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG)**: Another battle royale game that was a major influence on the genre's popularity. PUBG features realistic shooting mechanics and a large open world for players to explore and engage in combat.

3. **Call of Duty: Warzone**: Part of the popular Call of Duty franchise, Warzone is a free-to-play battle royale game that gained a massive player base. It features the fast-paced action and shooting mechanics characteristic of the Call of Duty series.

4. **Apex Legends**: Developed by Respawn Entertainment, Apex Legends is a team-based battle royale game that introduced unique character abilities to the genre. It quickly gained a dedicated player base.

5. **Destiny 2**: Combining elements of the shooter and RPG genres, Destiny 2 offers a mix of cooperative and competitive gameplay in a science fiction setting.

6. **Monster Hunter: World**: This action RPG gained significant popularity with its cooperative gameplay focused on hunting and battling giant monsters.
